## Here come the robots

Messing around with SVG and CSS/javascript as a learning exercise.. still work-in-progress.

random names are generated using the name_generator.js from [donjon.bin.sh](https://donjon.bin.sh/code/name/) with a big list of names for star wars droids I wrote based on entries in [wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Droid/).

Inspired by [Vanessasaurus](https://vsoch.github.io/robots/) - hers are still *much* cuter, but I have more.
