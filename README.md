## Here come the robots

I'm following a web-development course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) that I bought when it was heavily discounted. Trying to update some old skills.. I got to messing around with SVG and CSS/javascript as a learning exercise.. still work-in-progress.

random names are generated using the name_generator.js from [donjon.bin.sh](https://donjon.bin.sh/code/name/) with a big list of names for star wars droids I wrote based on entries in [wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Droid/).

Inspired by [Vanessasaurus](https://vsoch.github.io/robots/) - hers are still *much* cuter, but I have more. I'll work on up-cuting my robots over the next few weeks.

for now, [grab some ugly clankers](https://random-robots.netlify.app/) live on netlify.
